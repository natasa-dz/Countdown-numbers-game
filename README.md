# Moj-Broj-Countdown-numbers-game-
∙"Moj Broj" is a game from a Serbian TV show "Slagalica", which is an interpretation of a British "Countdown". The rules are pretty simple: Given a set of numbers X1-X5, calculate using mathematical operations to solve for Y. You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The goal is to get a number as close as possible to Y.
